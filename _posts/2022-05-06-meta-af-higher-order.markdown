## Coming soon!

We will release code, demos, and model checkpoints after the conference review period. The code will be released as a pull-request to the existing [Meta-AF repository](https://github.com/adobe-research/MetaAF).

For now, check out the initial Meta-AF [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=incb1QNSvW8), [pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11942), [code](https://github.com/adobe-research/MetaAF), [demos](/metaaf/demos), and [website](/projects/metaaf).
