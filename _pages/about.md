I am a Research Scientist at Adobe Research, and am interested in machine learning for audio (or other) signal processing. I earned a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I was advised by Prof. [Paris Smaragdis](http://paris.cs.illinois.edu/). My thesis was on adaptive filtering and proposed a new paradigm called meta-adaptive filtering. I also did my B.S. at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in Statistics and Computer Science. Feel free to check out my [publications page](/publications/) or my [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QwAo-K4AAAAJ&hl=en) to see what I've been up to lately.

I am enthusiastic about collaborating with students through research internships at Adobe Research in San Francisco. The internship program spans 3-4 months during the summer. If you are passionate about applying machine learning, deep learning, or signal processing to audio, I encourage you to get in touch. Please send me your CV along with a brief explanation of your research interests. My adobe page is [here](https://research.adobe.com/person/jonah-casebeer/).
