Hi there, I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I also completed my undergraduate studies at UIUC where I majored in [Statistics & Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/bs-statistics-computer-science). I'm interested in building tools which blend between analytic signal processing methods and data-driven machine learning approaches to make faster, better, and easier to design models. In this line of work, I've worked on approaches for acoustice echo cancellation, equalization, dereverberation, and beamforming.

I am advised by [Paris Smaragdis](http://paris.cs.illinois.edu/) and have had the chance to work with some great collaborators including [Nick Bryan](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~njb/), [Umut Isik](https://www.math.uci.edu/~isik/index.html), and [Ivan Dokmanic](http://dokmanic.ece.illinois.edu/). Feel free to check out what we've done on my [publications page](/publications/) or my [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QwAo-K4AAAAJ&hl=en) page.
