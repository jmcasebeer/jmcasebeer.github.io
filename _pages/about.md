Hi there, I'm Jonah. I'm interested in machine learning for signal processing and especially enjoy applications in audio. Feel free to check out my [publications page](/publications/) or my [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QwAo-K4AAAAJ&hl=en) to see what I've been up to lately.

I am a Research Scientist at Adobe Research, and have a Ph.D. in Computer science from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), where I was advised by [Paris Smaragdis](http://paris.cs.illinois.edu/). My thesis was on adaptive filtering and proposed a new paradigm called meta-adaptive filtering. I also did my B.S. at UIUC in Statistics and Computer Science.
