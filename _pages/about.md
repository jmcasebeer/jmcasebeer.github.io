Hi there, I'm a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I also completed my undergraduate studies at UIUC where I majored in [Statistics & Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/undergraduate/degree-program-options/bs-statistics-computer-science). I'm interested in building tools which blend between analytic signal processing methods and data-driven machine learning approaches to make faster, better, and easier to design models. In this line of work, I've worked on approaches for acoustic echo cancellation, equalization, dereverberation, beamforming, and source separation.

I am advised by [Paris Smaragdis](http://paris.cs.illinois.edu/) and have had the chance to work with some great collaborators including [Nick Bryan](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~njb/), [Umut Isik](https://www.math.uci.edu/~isik/index.html), and [Ivan Dokmanic](http://dokmanic.ece.illinois.edu/). Feel free to check out what we've done on my [publications page](/publications/) or my [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QwAo-K4AAAAJ&hl=en) page.

You might also be interested in the work done by my lab mates: [Efthymios Tzinis](https://efthymios.web.illinois.edu/), [Zhepei Wang](https://zhepeiw.com/), and [Krishna Subramani](https://krishnasubramani.web.illinois.edu/)
